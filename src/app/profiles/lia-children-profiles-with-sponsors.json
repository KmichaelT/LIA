He lives in a small home with his father, a hardworking farmer, who struggles daily to provide even the most basic necessities. The family often survives on just one meal a day, in an area with no clean water, electricity, or access to adequate healthcare. Boreda, while rich in agricultural potential, suffers from outdated farming methods, limited market access, and insufficient resources. Schools are poorly equipped, and harmful traditions like child marriage and child migration rob children of their opportunities, especially girls. Eyob's circumstances are challenging, but his unwavering determination to become a doctor and give back to his community sets him apart."
